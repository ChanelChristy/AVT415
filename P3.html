	<h2>Scenario</h2>	
	<p>Blair is a college student who majors in Fashion at the Fashion Institue of Technology in New York. She had to put together a fashion show for a final project showcasing rare and vintage clothing items, but she put it off until last minute and didn't have time to go to countless stores and look for these items. She looked online and found "Timeless." An online vintage clothing store that had the option to buy or rent clothes, alonng with a delivery or pick-up in person option. She browses the online store and finds exactly what she needs for her final project. By doing so she saved a ton of time, was relieved to find one place that had everything she needed, and was able to present her final project in time.</p>
